Some simple rules for posting issues and pull requests for Clockwork for Dynamo

### Issues
- **When posting bugs: Describe what you were doing, what went wrong and what you were expecting to happen.** Include screenshots, graphs and Revit models where applicable.
- **Also when posting bugs: Describe your setup.** (Operating Sytem, Dynamo version, Revit version & build number) Do **not** post bugs that occur in daily builds of Dynamo.
- **When posting wishes: Go wild.** After all, it's a wish, right?
- **Make sure you are running the *latest available* version** (see https://github.com/andydandy74/ClockworkForDynamo#versions)
- **Make sure your installed version of Clockwork matches the Dynamo version it's installed for** (e.g. Clockwork for Dynamo 1.x is *not* installed for Dynamo 2.x)
- **Make sure you do *not* have multiple versions of Clockwork installed for one Dynamo version** (e.g. Clockwork for Dynamo 1.x and Clockwork for Dynamo 2.x installed for the same Dynamo version). Please check your packages folder!
- **Make sure you do *not* have any of my pre-Clockwork packages installed** (see https://github.com/andydandy74/ClockworkForDynamo/wiki/Deprecated-Nodes-&-Packages#pre-clockwork-packages)

### Pull Requests
